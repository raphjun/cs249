/**
 * Suppose you entered a contest to be the last person remaining in a group. The
 * way the game works is that everyone forms a circle and individuals count off
 * up to a certain number in clockwise order. Once the number is reached that
 * person is eliminated and the count begins at 1 with the next person in the
 * circle.
 *
 * Design and implement an application to help ensure you win the contest.
 * Inputs are the number of people in the circle, the number used for counting
 * off, and the location where counting starts. The output should be the
 * location you should start in to be the last person remaining. You should use
 * a circular singly linked list. The output is the list of persons being
 * eliminated, each person should have a name representing their original
 * position in the circle (e.g., person1, person2, etc.).
